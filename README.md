## Enemies

### Enemy Mitch
Hey, that’s you! Wait, no it’s not, that’s an Enemy Mitch! These guys are just like you, they can use the parts of other monsters. Since this ability makes them so adaptable, they don’t just stay in one area, they can be found all over the island, and they are guaranteed to drop whatever part they are using.





### Sam
Whoa, does this guy have giant toes for feet?! Anyway, these guys are real brawlers. Their punches deal twice as much damage as other monster’s melee attacks, but somehow they don’t let them swing weapons harder.




### Charles
This guy may not be quite as strong as Sam, but you don’t wanna mess with him when he has a melee weapon. All that training he’s done in the mountains has really paid off, so much so that he can deal twice as much damage with a melee weapon than other monsters can.





### Randall
Randall may look like your typical dorky nerd, but don’t let that small frame fool you. Since he’s so skinny, he can run almost twice as fast as other monsters, so if he spots you, he’ll come out swinging like a bat outta H E double hockey sticks.



### Robot
No one really knows who made this guy, since the monsters on Monster Island aren’t exactly rocket scientists, but what we do know is that you will never have to worry about going a round with this guy, since he’s been broken up into pieces to be sold at shops. And good thing too! This monster of a monster has an ability for each of his parts, from drills that can bore through walls, to laser shooting out of eyes, if this guy were ever to be put back together, he would be quite the tough customer!




### Cactus
You want to be careful around this prickly fellow. He can shoot spreads of three needles out of each of his hands if he feels threatened. Which is a lot. He’s kind of a scaredy cat. As a side note, most people think that he actually grew out of that little pot of his, but no! He just decided he liked it one day, and now he just refuses to leave home without it.








### Kangaroo
This jolly jumping fellow has got quite a spring in his step! He can jump almost twice as high as other monsters, although since the desert does not have many high to reach places, he never really gets the chances to make the most out of his gift. That said, if you ever need to tussle with him, try not to get him jumping, since he’s at his best when attacking from the air.






### Vulture
Speaking of attacking from the air, if you thought getting jumped by a Kangaroo was bad, try a Vulture! These floaty guys are so light on their wings, they float through the air when they fall. However, they must be skipping arm (or wing) day at the gym, because they still can’t manage any actual flight








### Turtle
These guys are not too tough, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t any less pain to fight as other monsters. These guys’ shells are hard as rock, so they never have to worry about being hurt from behind. Due to this confidence, they are usually not too keen on protecting their heads. See if you can try to reach around and surprise them from above.





### Shark Boy
Well look who it is! It’s Shark Boy! He must have finally gotten out of that abyss of his and decided to take a vacation at Monster Island! And of course he brought with him his trusty swordfish. That weapon gives him some decent range so you better be careful. That said, those gills he has there look pretty handy for breathing underwater…








### Lobster
This buff crustacean loves to flex his arms. He flexes them so hard, he can even shoot them out like pistols! Doing this is pretty tiring though, so he is vulnerable for a few moments after doing this.







### Frog
This slimy dude isn’t quite as jumpy as you might expect, but what he lacks in ups, he makes up for in licks (ew). He’ll flick his tongue out super quick, so he has a little more range than most monsters, but thankfully it doesn’t do too much damage.










### Lion
This proud lion can tussle with the best of them, but as a lion should, he still has his pride. It’s because of this pride that if someone should dare sneak up on him from behind, he’ll get so angry that he’ll let out a roar that can push you back.







### Monkey
These clever little guys are the only monsters on the island that are smart enough to make their own weapons, instead of having to get them from shops. Because of this, it’s quite a rare sight to see one of these guys without their trusty club or banana gun.









### Wingus
These guys love making the Vultures jealous by rubbing in how they can fly with smaller wings, and still have opposable thumbs. They like to show off their avian digits by using the Squeaky Hammer weapon to bring the pain on anyone foolish enough to mock their winged majesty.







### Dingus
This burly toucan is blessed with the most ripped of bods, but its pride and joy is still its beak, so much so that it even avoids using its massive arms to attack, and instead pecks at foes with its beak.







### Hingus
Don’t be fooled by that cute and happy smile, this is one nasty harpy. She’ll jump into the air and flail her talons at you if you get on her bad side.








### Mummy
Being a rotten undead corpse wrapped in toilet paper would put a damper in anyone’s step, which is why the Mummy is so much slower than anyone else. But since he is rotting, he has plenty of rancid gas that he can cough up into a cloud of acid that lingers for a few seconds before disappearing.








### Knight
Unfortunately for this guy, since he is an incorporeal spirit, he has to posses a suit of armor to really do much of anything. Fortunately though, this also means that he has no trouble teleporting short distances, which he likes to do at intervals to mix up his enemies.







### Skeleton
This guy is hands down the spookiest of the castle bunch. Not only that, but he has quite the funny bone, a lot of them actually. So many in fact, that he has no trouble sharing them with others by chucking them overhead at anyone he sees.






### Dragon
There he is! That’s the big brute that started this whole mess! Although, I guess you cant totally blame him, I doubt he really wanted to have his parts scattered across the island. Well, nevertheless, he’s looking for someone to blame, and you’re the only one in front of him. Better make sure your nice and ready to fight this legend.
